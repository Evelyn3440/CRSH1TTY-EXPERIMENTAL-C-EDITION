# The exploit for the truly desperate
Disable WP on CR50 devices without opening it, just requires a chromebook in devmode and a ton of time.
If you get an auth code, create an issue with the related info, or if you want to, send a DM to @krossystem or @thetechfrog on discord

# Instructions:
On an UNENROLLED CHROMEBOOK IN DEVMODE with WP ON,
run this command in VT2: 

```wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Whelement/CRSH1TTY-public-beta/main/fast.sh | bash```

or for an alternative method, download fast.sh, place it in your "downloads" folder, and run this command in VT2:

```cd /home/user/chronos/Downloads && bash fast.sh```

and just wait!

# Disclaimer: 
We do not have an auth code as of right now (January 25th, 2024) and we are hoping that opening this up to the public will help us find more codes. This is not the final product, just a beta! Also, don't bother reporting this to Google as they won't care ever.
